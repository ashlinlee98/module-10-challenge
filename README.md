  ## Installation
  Just run an npm i which should get you the dependencies you need, which are pg, inquirer, dotenv, and express. You will need to update your .env file with your own postgreSQL information.

  ## Usage
  Use it to keep track of the people in your company. Keep track of employees, what deparment they're in, their manager, their salary, etc.
